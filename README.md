This is an attempt to get a U-Net CNN set up for image processing/segmentation

This was made to try to identify cells in images of cells
The files have been reduced to 130 images for training instead of the provided 670 (due to upload limits)

The images were part of the 2018 Data Science Bowl

1. Download zip file
2. Unzip the contents
3. Unpack the Data Science Bowl folder att he same level as the .py file
4. Open U-Net_Test.py in a Python IDE (Spyder, for example)
5. Run the code (it takes a while to finish) 

Notes made in body of code for further elaboration
